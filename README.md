# DPAMFA_CodingSamples
A collection of two samples of code for the DPA MFA portfolio.

To veiw the first sample, please refer to "shapeAndShelfTool.py" 

This tool procedurally generates a scene in Maya and creates a custom shelf tool. It is a combiation of work created in DPA 4000. 

To veiw the second sample, please refer to "flag.py" 

This code creates 6 unique flags, including the French, Belgian, Canadian, Finnish, and Japanese flag. This is an expanded version of work I created for DPA 4000. It utilizes PIL and NumPY in order to create 6 unique flag designs.

You will need to clone the repository, or download the two pngs, leaf.png and red_circle.png in order to correctly run this code.
